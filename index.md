## Welcome to my first ever personal website 

I have been thinking to make my own website, so here it is. I'm going to work on this a little bit everyday to shape it towards my vision. Ideally, this will be a place where I can summarize what I have done around Human Computer Interaction, including projects, reflection on readings and brainstorms. I also would like to build a habit of summarizing and reflecting on my readings. So, I might include some personal stuff as well. We will see :)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zoelzw/zoelzw.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
