		Maybe I should jump out of all of the game, I thought. There is no perfection, but rather the OCD alike habits and standards one hold for themselves. One doesn't need any validations because they have the confidence that they deserve the things that they work hard for. There are some cool characters in this movie. The chef who finally stepped out of his fantasy started to build a home that he was lacking in his childhood. The supportive wife who was cool AF might be the one who has experienced the pain with her husband but choose to tough it out. I hope she is happy as she deserves it too. The girl who got angry at the chef when he decided to close up the restaurant didn't shock me. I mean, I could see it coming when he shared her story of how she got started. I felt like we are in a similar stage where we get angry at things and people sometimes. The pastry chef, of course, was a lucky and tough guy. Great movie.
