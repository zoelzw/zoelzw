    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      Gait dysfunctions often lead to walking patterns that are different from able-bodied walking patterns. Physical therapists (PT) usually rely on observations to diagnose and plan interventions specific to these patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is expected that PT students learn to extract features from these patterns through education and practices. So, where do they look at to evaluate gait patterns? Could we use this information to determine whether the diagnosis is reliable or how they transform knowledge into practices? What is the information that an individual is using to determine normal walking? 
    </p> 
    <p>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> We compared what body areas PT students and novices are looking at for gathering information when evaluating gait patterns. We used principal component analysis to transform joint motion of two amputee walkers and a able-bodied walkers into three biological motion models. We then build six videos from each model displaying a synthesized point-light walker for participants to observe. They were asked to rank the videos based on how normal they appeared.

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p> 
      In this project, I participated in data modeling and user studies. I learned the basics of gait cycles and principal component analysis through practice. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      I recruited ten subjects and conducted user studies with them. Additionally, I was responsible for data cleaning and processing. I explored different ways of analyzing the heat map of participants' fixations, including basic machine learning and computer vision techniques. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      We found that novices spent most time fixating the legs (78.37%) while PT students spent relatively more time on pelvic (21%) and shoulder (20.93%). There were also follow-up studies to investigate this direction and prepare domain knowledge for advanced machine learning projects.

    <h2>And beyond...</h2>
    <br>
     <p> 
      Embodiment has been widly discussed across the fields of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Psychology, Robotics, and so on. I am also very interested in the concept of embodying foreign objects since it may enable new paradiams in HCI. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      For instance, Human Computer Integration apply this concept to an extrem that the human body and machines become one. Will this be the future? Is it possible to change our implicit social bias by putting ourselves in other peopleâ€™s <s>shoes</s> bodies? 
    </p>
    <p> 
      I led a reading group with my colleague Jun Nishida to review related literature and brianstorm with the HCI club at Uchicago.
