    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      Embodied interaction tells us that “how we understand the world, ourselves, and interaction comes from our location in a physical and social world”. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers have turned to wearable devices that enable users to experience the sense of having a different body, such as size-illusions based on Virtual Reality. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Could we achieves this in the user’s real environment, preserving the user’s physical and social contexts? 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> HandMorph, a passive exoskeleton that miniaturizes grasp, provides a unique spin on wearables to passively simulate a child's hand and offers adults a new grasp of empathy while they can still interact with the physical world.

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p> 
      In this project, I led the second user study to examine participants’ experiences with HandMorph and participated in paper writting. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      To investigate whether HandMorph could assist in evaluating/designing products for people with smaller hands, I recruited eight participants to improve the design of a simple toy trumpet to be used by smaller persons, such as chil­dren (ages 3-10). 
    </p>
    <p> 
      We found that they felt more confident in their simple toy designs when using HandMorph to test their design’s ergonomics.

    <h2>And beyond...</h2>
    <br>
     <p> 
      Embodiment has been widly discussed across the fields of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Psychology, Robotics, and so on. I am also very interested in the concept of embodying foreign objects since it may enable new paradiams in HCI. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      For instance, Human Computer Integration apply this concept to an extrem that the human body and machines become one. Will this be the future? Is it possible to change our implicit social bias by putting ourselves in other people’s <s>shoes</s> bodies? 
    </p>
    <p> 
      I led a reading group with my colleague Jun Nishida to review related literature and brianstorm with the HCI club at Uchicago.
