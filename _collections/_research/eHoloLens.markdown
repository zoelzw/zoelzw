    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      Obstacle Avoidance training is widely used in the rehabilitation of patients with mobility limitations. However, this training is limited in clinical environments due to difficulty to generate training courses and potential risks related to the training procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To overcome these problems, many researchers introduced XR (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality) technology to the training. For example, Microsoft HoloLens was used to generate an obstacle crossing system for gait rehabilitation of amputee and stroke patients. However, it is still unknown whether the HoloLens based AR has a potential influence on obstacle avoidance training results. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the AR obstacle crossing training affects subjects’ obstacle avoidance strategy compared with their strategies used in a physical obstacle crossing training.

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p> 
      I initiated the project idea and went through rounds of literature review and MR design. I participated in IRB writing and gained financial support from the OUR office. I also independently designed and conducted experiments with six able-bodied subjects using HoloLens and Vicon motion capture system. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Lastly, I overcame challenges in biomechanical data analysis using MATLAB and presented the findings in 2018 BMES conference. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      We found that subjects tend to walk more consistently across trials for the physical obstacle condition compared to the AR obstacle condition. HoloLens-based Augmented Reality Obstacle Avoidance Training Has Varying Impact on Individuals’ Obstacle Avoidance Strategies.

    <h2>And beyond...</h2>
    <br>
     <p> 
      This was an independent research project as well as a journey for me to go through the whole research process from grant proposal writing to final presentation. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      The experience was fundamental for me to understand how to face setbacks and research questions rigorously and efficiently. Most importantly, I learned how to formulate my ideas into impactful research.
    </p>
    <p> 
      I received many interesting and challenging questions during the poster sessions. Some people expressed their excitement about emerging technologies, while others showed their concerns. All the feedbacks inspired me to search for effective Human Computer Interaction that augments human performance and experiences.
