title:  "HoloLens-based Augmented Reality Obstacle Avoidance Training Has Varying Impact on Individuals’ Obstacle Avoidance Strategies"
# author: Patrick Henry

description: In order to gauge the application of Mixed Reality in building safer and programmable obstacle training courses for rehabilitation, I compared people’s obstacle avoidance strategies in HoloLens-based Mixed Reality and in reality.

       Obstacle Avoidance training is widely used in the rehabilitation of patients with mobility limitations. However, this training is limited in clinical environments due to difficulty to generate training courses and potential risks related to the training procedure. To overcome these problems, many researchers introduced XR (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality) technology to the training. For example, Microsoft HoloLens was used to generate an obstacle crossing system for gait rehabilitation of amputee and stroke patients. However, it is still unknown whether the HoloLens based AR has a potential influence on obstacle avoidance training results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the AR obstacle crossing training affects subjects’ obstacle avoidance strategy compared with their strategies used in a physical obstacle crossing training.

      With IRB approval and informed consent, we tested 6 able-bodied subjects (without any apparent or self-reported physical or mental impairments in our screening survey), who walked through a 1625 mm long and 963 mm wide obstacle course on a platform with HoloLens. A self-developed App was used to display virtual obstacles on the platform. The sizes of the virtual obstacles were the same as the physical obstacles

      The subjects wore the HoloLens during all the tests and the App was turned on only in the virtual trials. Each subject went through 10 trials with 5 virtual trials and 5 physical trials in a row. Whether the subject experienced virtual trials first of the physical trials first was decided randomly. We recorded kinematics using a motion capture system and generated trajectories of their center of mass. Lastly, participants completed a modified Presence questionnaire [2] to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual environments.
