    <h2>motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      The Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) is an annual track competition that is held on grand prix or road style closed courses. This unique style of solar car racing is open to teams from around the world and truly tests the limits of the vehicles in handling curves, braking, and acceleration. On years when the American Solar Challenge (ASC) is held, FSGP serves as the qualifier event for this competition. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Solar vehicles are limited to the impression of one-seaters that are built for competitions. Can we make a solar vehicle that can not only compete but also bring practical value off the track?
    </p>
    <p> 
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>As NC State's first solar vehicle team, SolarPack is aiming to show the world that solar energy can be used to power a multi-occupancy car that can run off the track.

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p> 
      As one of the founding team members, I spent most of the time collaborating with my teammates, learning, and working on hands-on tasks. I learned about the Battery Management System and CAN bus by simulating them in MATLAB Simulink as well as playing with real systems.
    </p>
    <p> 
      I also learned soldering, basic PCB making, and even welding, which gave me confidence and the necessary foundations to start my own hands-on research later.
    </p>
     <p> 
      I participated in the 2017 Formula Sun Grand Prix with another three teammates to learn about the competition and to offer help to other teams.

    <h2>And beyond...</h2>
    <br>
     <p> 
       With the development of technology, our relationship with it is no longer only "tool use." What would be the "best" dynamic to use technology to unlock the potential of humans? For instance, how can we use the power of technology to help marginalized populations instead of using it as capital to serve the privileged? How can we sustainably use technology? 
    </p>
    <p> 
      To attempt to answer my own questions, I worked with people with disabilities and learned about their needs and opinions on emerging technologies. I also worked on several projects related to sustainability in hackathons.
