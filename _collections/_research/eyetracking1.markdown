    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      where do amputees look at when they approach to stairs? What can we do with this information to design a co-adapation system for amputees and robotic prothesis?

      This paper aims to investigate the visual strategy of transtibial amputees while they are approaching the tran- sition between level-ground and stairs and compare it with that of able-bodied individuals.

      This project aims to investigate the visual strategy of transtibial amputees while they are approaching the transition between level-ground and stairs and compare it with that of able-bodied individuals. To this end, we conducted a pilot study where two transtibial amputee subjects and two able-bodied subjects transitioned from level-ground to stairs and vice versa while wearing eye tracking glasses to record gaze fixations.
