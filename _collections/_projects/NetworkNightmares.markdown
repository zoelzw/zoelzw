      Network Nightmares is a Virtual Reality game in Google Cardboard that turns frustrating network debugging work into a fun process in VR. My teammates and I developed this project in the Triangle VR Hackathon which was named after the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area of Raleigh/Durham under the VR Hackathon organization. The theme of the hackathon is "tools of trade", and there were over 90 participants from different fields. The judging criteria are design, methodology, execution, and creativity.

      Networks are very complicated since it is abstract and non-tangible. I had the idea to use VR to visualize abstract concepts and to facilitate programmers' work. For instance, when a virus travels within a network, it may damage different nodes. It would be fun and practical to trace back the trajectory of the virus and debug it.

      We designed the visualization of nodes and links that represent networks. The "virus" travel from node to node and cannot skip any node in between. The node that had been visited was marked as different colors to indicate the order of the visits. The player had to look around and make judgments to find the virus and "kill it." We developed this project in Unity with C#. We also designed our logo and avatars in Maya. I worked on the spatial audios as another hint to the players.

      This was my first experience with VR and Hackathon. I immediately loved the dynamic of Hackathons and the potentials of VR. I enjoy the intensive thinking and making process. It was very stressful, challenging, yet fun. I tend to have the habit of thinking about an idea and not implementing it. I struggled with being perfect, so it was very refreshing for me to try my best and to see what I could do within 48 hours.
