      In this project, my teammates and I worked on a PID controller for the Lego Mindstorm Unmanned Vehicle. We designed the controller and distance sensor to complete the following tasks: path tracking, parking, and platooning.

      Here's the route that the UV went through.

      We designed the visualization of nodes and links that represent networks. The "virus" travelled from node to node with a set of logics we designed. The node that had been visited was marked as different colors to indicate the order of the visits. The player had to look around and make judgments to find the virus. We developed most of the project in Unity with C# and assets in Maya and Illustrator. I mainly worked on the spatial audios as another hint to the players.

      This was my first experience with VR and Hackathons. I immediately loved the dynamic of Hackathons and the magic of VR. I enjoyed the intensive thinking and making process. It was very stressful, challenging, yet fun. It might sound cheesy, but I did struggle with perfectionism. It was very refreshing for me to try my best and to see what I could do within 48 hours without worrying too much about the outcomes.
