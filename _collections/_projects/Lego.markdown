        People always say that history repeats itself, and I think history also shines a light on the unknown future, or at least we can find some patterns from the past to guide ourselves in present.

The transformation of eyewear as objects of necessity into objects of desire enhanced my belief in inclusive design particularly in clothing and gave me a different angle to reevaluate today’s advocacy of inclusive design.
