    <p> 
      There are many apps and tools available online to help people manage their tasks and time. However, they do not share the information that could potentially be used to better serve users. I had the idea to make an all-in-one app that can not only serve as a to-do list but also a recommendation system that monitors users' tasks and recommends tasks for them to complete in limited time slots.

    <p>
       The application is a to-do list that users can add and check tasks. It is also a tool that blocks users' access to their mobile phone. Users can start a task by press start and then press finished to mark the time that they used. We implemented basic machine learning models to predict the completion time of tasks in users' to-do lists based on previous records.

      I really love this idea and will revisit it later.
