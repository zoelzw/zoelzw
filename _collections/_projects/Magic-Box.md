      In this project, my teammates and I worked on a PID controller for the Lego Mindstorm Unmanned Vehicle. We designed the controller and distance sensor to complete the following tasks: path tracking, parking, and platooning.

      I enjoyed working on this project and found it very helpful to exercise theories that I learned from classes. I had a dream where I was a PID controller with automation tuning features. I also wrote a long reflection called "If I were a PID Controller, which I couldn't find anymore.
