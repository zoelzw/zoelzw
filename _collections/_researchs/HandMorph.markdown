       HandMorph transforms the user’s grasping range by means of its mechanical linkages, which transmit both movements and force from the user’s own fingers to their respective small rubber fingers

        Unlike other size-illusions based on virtual reality, HandMorph achieves this in the user's real environment, preserving the user's physical and social contexts. As such, our device can be integrated into the user's workflow, e.g., to allow product designers to momentarily change their grasping range into that of a child while evaluating a toy prototype.
