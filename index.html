        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Zoe Liu!</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my personal website. 
        I have been thinking to make my own website, so here it is. 
        Iâ€™m going to work on this a little bit everyday to shape it towards my vision. 
        Ideally, this will be a place where I can summarize what I have done around Human Computer Interaction, including projects, reflection on readings and brainstorms. 
        I also would like to build a habit of summarizing and reflecting on my readings. So, I might include some personal stuff as well. 
        We will see :)<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
