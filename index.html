    <p class="about">I am a pre-doctoral student at the University of Chicago working in the Human Computer Integration Lab. I will graduate from my master’s program in Computer Science this December and am looking for mentors and friends for my next stage of research in Human-Computer Interaction. Previously, I got my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina State University, where I also did research in the Neuromuscular Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory in the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at NCSU and UNC.

    <p class="about">I am interested in designing interactive devices and tools that work harmoniously with the human body to empower all people. I explore the means to use technology as tools that bring independence to people in the field of sustainability, rehabilitation, and design.  </p>
    <!-- <p class="about">“One should be light like a bird, and not like a feather.”  This single line of a poem from Paul Valéry has guided me through major life events and led me to decisions that defined who I am, which was also reflected in my research. Being light like a bird resonants with my lifelong goal to be independent, resilient, and creative. More importantly, different from a feather who has no purpose nor control and lost in the wind, a bird fights against the odds and even manipulate the wind to reach new heights. I realized in my research that technology is like the wind, which enables us to go beyond human limitations but could also diminish the feathers, such as the connections among people and between our bodies and souls that made us beautiful. My exploration of Human-Computer Interaction is also my journey to search for means to be more independent and creative with the help of technology. Besides it being a huge part of my identity, building empowering tools that work harmoniously with the human body is a dream that I am eager to pursuit to allow others to reach their fullest potential
